SCREENING OF EYE DISEASES FROM RETINAL IMAGES

There is a need to develop a system that can analyse retinal images and identify eye diseases. This suggests that there is a desire to automate or improve the efficiency of the screening process for eye diseases by utilizing retinal images.

Typically, the screening process involves examining the retina, which is the inner lining at the back of the eye, to identify any abnormalities or signs of eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, macular degeneration, or other retinal disorders.

By utilizing transfer learning, we can leverage pre-trained deep learning models on large-scale datasets to extract meaningful features from retinal images and train a classifier specifically for eye disease detection.
